# Theory and Design

A program can be written and use several npm modules to quickly build
a finished functional application. The design of npm allows for the
reuse of modules and while ensuring the dependencies of those modules
and are available and match the correct versions.

The npm repository has a large variety of modules that add
functionality, and speed development. The modules have available
versions and requirements spanning several years and versions of
NodeJS. This allows for long-term stability when deploying, as well
as targeting newer versions.

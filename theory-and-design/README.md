# Theory and Design

A program can be written and use several npm packages to quickly
build a finished functional application. The design of npm allows for
the reuse of packages and while ensuring the dependencies of those
packages and are available and match the correct versions.

The npm repository has a large variety of packages that add
functionality, and speed development. The packages have available
versions and requirements spanning several years and versions of
NodeJS. This allows for long-term stability when deploying, as well
as targeting newer versions.
